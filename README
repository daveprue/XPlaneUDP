Here is some sample Arduino code that registers over UDP with X-Plane (10 or 11) 
and receives the datarefs back at the requested frequency.  Note that this is 
written specifically for the ESP8266 variant (WeMOS D1 and D1 Mini), and would 
need to be reworked to run on a Arduino Mega (or other variant) with an ethernet 
shield. (I would have ported it already, but I don't have an ethernet shield handy).

The real beauty of this approach is that it requires no plugins or any other "middleware".

If you have any questions about the code, just ask.  I would be happy to explain any part.


Notice two things that can be gotchas:

1.  In subscribe()  it seems that X-Plane will only honor your request if you pass a "complete" 
request packet, i.e. 400 bytes of request area, and it must also be initialized to spaces (0x20) 
in all the unused parts.  If X-Plane is not happy with your request, it simply IGNORES it, it does 
not reply with any error message.

2.  Alignment can be an issue.  Obviously, for speed you want to load a complete int or float 
instead of doing four byte loads from the buffer, but to do this, the fields in the received buffer 
need to be on a four-byte aligned boundary.  This means that you have to offset the udp read to 
make everything line up.

Anyway, just some observations.  I have this code running cleanly on a D1 over Wifi.  It finds X-Plane,
subscribes, and receives data refs.
